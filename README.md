# 3D-LAFM
This is a workflow to construct 3D-LAFM density maps, build 3D-LAFM-MDFF force field (UAFM), and encode/decode AFM1 file from (HS-)AFM experiments. The codes are developed in BIO-AFM-LAB at Weill Cornell Medicine under the supervision of Professor Simon Scheuring.

Developer: Yining Jiang, Zhaokun Wang
